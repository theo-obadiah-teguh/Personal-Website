# My Personal Website

This is the repository containing the source code and assets for my personal website. It contains several hyperlinks to my projects, my resume and past work experience, as well as a personal blog which is still currently under development. The website was built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was then deployed with AWS S3, AWS CloudFront, and AWS Route 53 on my personal domain.
